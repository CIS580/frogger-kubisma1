    <h1>Play Frogger</h1>
    <canvas id="screen" width="760" height="480"></canvas>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Use your left, up and right arrow key to run the frog across the<br />
       road and the river. Stay aware of cars, they can hit you. Jump on logs<br />
       in order not to be drown.</p>
    <p>Somehow it works. I spent so much time developing this game (approx. 30 hours) <br />
       and still I'm not satisfied with the game behaviour. I think it's too <br />
       much for one-week assignment...</p>
